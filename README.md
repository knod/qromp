qgameWebapp
===========

In progress, aiming towards a web-based visual and interactive qgame programming environment.

See [here](https://github.com/zhx2013/qgame-seesaw) for a non-web-based previous attempt.

See [here](https://github.com/omriBernstein/qgame) for the back-end quantum computer simulator.

Currently, this "app" is just using [samrat's happy-dashboard code](https://github.com/samrat/happy-dashboard) as an arbitrary starting point.
