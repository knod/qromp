-Gray out plus or minus if not allowed to decrease or increase, respectively
-Minus and plus signs are not vertically aligned with each other
-About section slides in, but same width as guide, pushes guide out but app remains visible
-Figure out weird bug with guide content being distorted
-Scroll bars in guide are ugly
-Justified guide text?
